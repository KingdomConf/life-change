Crystal is married to Randy; together, they have six children, eleven grandchildren, and one on the way. Serving in the Children's ministry brings her great joy. Something that stands out to her is that you truly never know the impact you have made or the harvest that will come from the seeds you have sown. As a little girl, it was a neighbor who volunteered for the bus ministry of his church who invited her. At that time, he had no idea the impact he was making on that little girl. He was simply being obedient to God.",
